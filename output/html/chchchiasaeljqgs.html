Hey there,

If you came here from chchchiajhk7jqci.onion and believed any of it,
please note that you are a gullible dumbass.

I (wowaname) have made it no secret who I am online; I can be found on
clearnet as well as Tor and I2P. This has always been the case. I spend
far more time on clearnet in fact, and I only operate hidden services
and participate in Tor communities because I believe in freedom of
speech and expression, and the power that anonymity/privacy gives the
average user to express that freedom.

As many of you know, Hidden Answers (the largest site operated by Chen
Hosting to date) is still up and running, as are all the other unnamed
personal and miscellaneous sites that I operate pro-bono at this point.
I do not get paid directly from hosting by many customers; hopefully
this will change and I can make enough to maintain server costs. I only
wish I could earn anywhere close to 200 BTC off hidden service hosting.
I've hardly earned one bitcoin off it all.

This troll / idiot operating chchchiajhk7jqci.onion either hates me
enough to claim that I'm scamming others, or just wants to start shit
and fish for a reaction, but in any case they know absolutely nothing
about me. It's impressive, actually, given how little I try to hide my
true self online. I'm a very honest person and I have made best efforts
to disallow scams and material I personally object. And I most certainly
do not misspell "doxed" -- it's one X.

My personal website is and has always been <https://wowana.me/>, it has
had a hidden service at <http://opalrwf4mzmlfmag.onion/> and
<http://opal.i2p/> for years (and I have no idea if the I2P link
actually *works* at any given time, since it's so unstable). My contact
and PGP information is and has always been there; lately I have also had
a Keybase profile (at <https://keybase.io/opal> or
<http://fncuwbiisyh6ak3i.onion/opal>) to make it easier to verify me.
And my current PGP key is signed by my previous one before I retired it,
and the previous was signed by the one before that, maintaining a long
chain of self-trust. Pull up any archived copy of the PGP keyservers,
and even if you don't really know who I am, you can easily verify that I
have at least been around with the same identity for a long time.

Nothing is compromised; I'm just fucking lazy. Nobody has been scammed
by my doing. I'm too busy working on programming hobbies (surprise! I
have code on git, also accessible through my personal website), too busy
finding an IRL job for myself, too busy trying to move out and start a
life for myself. Too busy to care about some faggot beating a dead
horse. I'm not really utilising the brand of Chen Hosting so it doesn't
matter where its reputation ends up; believe whatever you want to
believe about it, it still isn't making money but I'll still keep what's
left of it running.

Verify this PGP signature and don't trust everything you see online.
Make your own damned judgment calls. This goes for anything: Tor,
clearnet, news on the TV, your friends, your politicians, .... Do
yourself a favour and think for yourself.

I may be lazy, I may be a jackass to a lot of people, but you cannot
call me dishonest.

Thank you for reading my blog post,
opal hart (wowaname)
