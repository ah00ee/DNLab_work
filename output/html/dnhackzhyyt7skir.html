  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <dl class="faq-list">

<!-- FAQ -->

      <dt>How much? How come I keep getting scammed when looking for someone to hack a FB account, Hotmail, same old story, etc. </dt>

      <dd><p>This is an expensive industry. Some clients require work 
that would cost upwards of thousands of dollars hiring or paying for an 
âEthical Hackerâ or âPenetration Testerâ in the real world where others 
might need access to an email account. What some people do not realize 
is that your asking something that would cost quite a bit of money and 
doing $100 for the same job is foolish to think would be an option. 
Furthermore, if your request is for obvious financial gain thereâs no 
reason why the hired hacker would use this to his/her advantage. This is
 why so many people get scammed. Need a bank account? CCâs? $100 for a 
hack? That's silly and you should get scammed thinking it's that cheap 
and that easy. An hourly rate is applied to all jobs. </p>
      <p>We accept legitimate clients who require professional, 
discrete, reliable, and credible hacking services. If this appeals to 
you then please do not hesitate to contact us for more information. Once
 we have an understanding of what you require we can provide you with 
more information along with prices associated to your request.</p>
