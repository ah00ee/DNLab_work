Why don't you cash out the cards yourselves?</h3>				    <p>We do it. Just not every single one, that would be definitely too risky. As said in the "About" tab, "giving the money away" is just an protection for us by making sure the cards aren't cashing out only in single area by us. It makes it easier for us to cash them out safely. We also can't really cash them all out, the amount of dirty money gone from the ATMs would attract some unwanted attention that could lead to a serious investigation.</p>			    </div>			    			                    <div class="title">				    <h3 style="color:#000000;">How can i order cards?</h3>				    <p>Select and pay for.
