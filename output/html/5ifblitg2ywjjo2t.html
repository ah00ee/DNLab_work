So many things the Dark Web relies on...linux, tor, bitcoins...are open source.<br>
So why not a bitcoin mixer? If you're mixing your coins, don't you have a right to know exactly how the mixer functions?<br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>The code is open source and based on the famous PenguinMixer. Just google it and take a look at the 
 source code yourself.</li>
<li>Never more than 3% mixing fee (it's randomized between 1% and 3%).</li> 
<li>The minimum mix amount is 0.001 BTC.</li>
<li>Log files are deleted after 3 days.</li>
<li>No JavaScript!</li>
</ul>
<p>
<font color="red">Be aware that the transaction fee will be deducted from the amount being sent to you.</font><br>
