<p>Whether you sell or buy drugs, guns, stolen credit cards, carding equipment, fake currency or other goods and services, you can use our secure multi-sig bitcoin escrow to pay and receive payment.</p>

<p>If you pay the vendor directly before receiving goods, he can scam you. If the vendor sends you goods first and then you pay, the customer can scam him.</p>

<p>The only secure way of payment between an anonymous customer and an anonymous vendor is a secure locker controlled by a 3rd party such as our service.</p>

<p>For a moderate fee, we hold the payment securely in a locker on our website until the vendor delivers the goods and services. Customer can either approve releasing the payment to the seller or he can open a dispute in case he did not receive the goods or services.</p>

<div ><img src="images/bitcoin.jpg"></div>

<p>In case of dispute, we review the transaction and we see which party is right. If the customer received the goods or services but he claims he didn't receive, we will send payment to the seller. If the customer didn't receive the goods or services we will refund the money back to the customer.</p>

<p>Question: How can buyers and sellers trust we arbitrate disputes correctly?</p>

<p>Answer: We keep the commission regardless of whether the money goes to the buyer or seller. It's in our best interest to decide correctly if the buyer received the goods or not because if not, they will spread the word and our reputation will be destroyed. No other customers will trust us. Is better to do legitimate business and help customers and vendors be safe because they will spread the word about us and we will get thousands of more customers.</p>

<p> Buyers and sellers fully anonymous. We do not need personal details and we do not ask for email addresses. </p>
