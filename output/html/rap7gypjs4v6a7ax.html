<strong>Hello.</strong><br>
        Some time ago, in my stupidity, I tried to make several transactions on the Dark 
Internet.<br> And you know how many times I was deceived?<br>
        - 6 freaking times. I think that this is already too much. <br><br>That is why I created this 
website so that you can check out if the product or service your are about to buy is really true or 
just another scam. The dark web is a tool to be safe, anonymous and hidden on the web where
 the government don't see everything you do.<br>
        <br>
        So before you order or buy, take a minute and check my list. If the onion site or person is 
listed on <a href="list.html">SCAM LINKS LIST</a>, then that people is about to steal your money and you should to think twice whether you 
want to lose your money. I add only verified scam-sites, with proofs of scams so I'm sure about it.<br><br> This list is no where complete and it never will, but together we can 
constantly supplement it. <br> If you have been scammed by someone, and this site isn't listed here, 
submit the site or the person using the <br><a href="submit.html">ADD NEW SCAM</a> link. <br>
        <br>
If you are legit seller and you have proofs for that or you are a buyer and want to recommend some site (and you have REAL proofs, not screenshot emails, fake photos, etc...) you can also write to me and in that case I'm gonna add you to <a href="veri.html"><font color="green">VERIFIED SITES</font></a>. If you are scammer and you offer me even $100 000 for deleting your site or add to verified - don't waste your and my time. Now after finding legit sellers I don't need your money - Honor and God are more important to me.<br><br>
Thank you!<br>
