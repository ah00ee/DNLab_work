            It all began in 2015. We were just a group of fools looking for a way to get some cash. You know how it usually looks like. We invested some cash on FOREX, we invested some into bitcoin, we tried pyramid schemes. Some day one of us jumped on TOR, we felt like we finally found a gold machine: clone cards, printed money. But it was not so simple.
          </p> <br>

          <p>
            We were ready to risk, we've done it before, we've lost our money many times already. But what happened then was ridiculous. Only one single order from seven that we've done happened to be legit. Owner of carding site sent us such a message: "Another fucking idiot, you got scammed".
          </p> <br>

          <p>
            Did you hear about placing credit card skimmers on ATMs? We've heard about it on media, we were convinced that they have to sell all those cards somewhere. Carders from first advert on TORCH scammed us but we tried to look deeper. We found great TOR forum on Reddit, one user sent us its address. And here we bought the first working cloned card. Card got blocked after first transaction but it happened -"IT'S REAL!!! LET'S GET FUCKING RICH".
          </p> <br>

          <p>
            You probably guess how we started, making little deals, buying cards, paypal accounts. However, hunger grows fast. We wanted more cash. And we got a proposal. "I'll send you a package of 544 hacked paypal accounts for 4 BTC". We were  discussing this shit so hard, it was so risky. Yes, we bought it, it was real. Some of them were empty, some of them with 5-10$. Some of them with real big cash. We could not cash it all out so we sold some of those accounts on the same forum we were buying stuff before. We became a sellers.
          </p> <br>

          <p>
            It grew pretty fast. We could cooperate with bigger clients, money we made we invested in real-life business so were able to wash money earned in darknet. And here we decided to join TORCH to break this fucking scamming market. We believe that good reputation may spread even to clearnet. We believe that we may affect all of this. We ain't hackers, we're still just a group of fools.
          </p> <br>

          <p>
            <span class="text-danger">
              Remember that using our service is illegal - you do it on your own responsibility. We've never heard about any of our clients having problems with law or being harassed by paypal, western union... but you need to be cautious. Never get too loud about money you get, jealous people may start to sniff. Also if we don't confrm that you have your own business that lets you to wash the money - we would not transfer you more than $10k per month as it would attract too much attention. Keep safe
