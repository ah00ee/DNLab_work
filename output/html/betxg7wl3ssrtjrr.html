<p style="text-align: center;">Hello.<br>

This site is for selling football game results.<br>

We are not a predictor.<br>
We do not predict football matches by chance. <br>

If you buy us a list of football results, you will win one hundred percent.<br>

You can't lose even one percent. And you can easily bet any amount you want.<br>

We buy a high-priced football list from a Russian person every week.<br>

Inside each list are 3 football games. And we get three lists every week.<br>

All the football games we receive are second division League. <br>
games from England, France and Germany. <br>

And we don't have a list of Premier League games. And it's almost as if the results of the Premier League games are impossible.<br>

We know from behind the scenes that we are buying these football results lists. And we get games whose results have already been determined.<br>

And unfortunately, we can't give you more information because it's a secret.<br>

We do not have a coefficient of more than 63.70 per week.<br>


We do not have the results of basketball, volleyball, and etc games.<br>
We only specialize in football.<br>

You may be wondering why we put this list up for sale and why we don't use it ourselves.<br>
Well, we use those lists ourselves and we bet every week. But we also sell them for more revenue and more transactions.<br>

You might think that the price list of our football results is expensive.<br>
In fact, it is true. But the information we give you is more valuable than that.<br>
But you have to pay for a good, real list. And that's our price.<br>

Buying from us is safe for you. And you can easily bet because it's legal. And the money you make this way is legal. <br>

Don't worry about betting and buying from us at all.<br>
Email us any problems you may have after purchasing. Email us to guide you. 24/7.<br>

We guarantee that if you are not satisfied with your purchase, we will refund all the money you paid us.<br>

You can choose many sites for betting, such as: 1xbet, bet 365, betwin, betway, melbet.<br>

And all of these sites accept bets on second division league football in England, Germany and France and etc.<br>


We will tell you the results of the game for the money you pay us.<br>


We have taken these photos for your further trust.<br>
