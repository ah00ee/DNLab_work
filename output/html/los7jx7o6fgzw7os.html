<p><font color="#FF0000">About us</font></p>
<p>Criminal Network is an association of proven experienced hitmen on onion. We are working predominantly in Europe and the US but have people in other countries. Ask about locations.</p>
<div style="float:right; padding-left:10px;"><img src="images/shot.jpg"></div>

<p>If you hate someone and want them to die you can contact us. We have resources to resolve your problem. Our hitmen have guns and enough experience to help you get your revenge.</p>

<p>This site is just a tool to contact us and start your commission. All your questions you can discuss with admin. Tell him about your commission in detail including name, location and image of the target. Don't talk about yourself and avoid phrases like “my ex-wife,” “my brother,” or something else like that.</p>

<p>Our goal is to bring employers and killers together for anonymous payment and the highest level of security. No personal information. Username only. There is no risk of meeting the killer in person. Your IP is hidden by the onion domain. So you are safe. And no one knows who you are. Payment is secure and anonymous. We accept Bitcoin or Monero. Transaction is considerably safer than a street-based criminal service as we don't ask for any cash advance. Most hitmen out of the dark net require half the amount of cash payment before killing. You can forget about everything when the hitman will take your money and disappear.</p>

<p>Bitcoin and Monero are an easy way to pay. This is one of the few payment methods that preserves the anonymity of the employer, our team and the hitman. All of your bitcoins are held in your escrow and cannot be accessed without your permission. Note that we need to make sure you have enough money before we kill. And you pay when the job is done.</p>

<p>Most of the murders are done by regular guys in hoods who use handguns and knives waiting for the victim outside the house. They have basic assassination skills and computer knowledge.</p>

<p>Why should you use our members to solve your problem? Because it is not expensive and extremely safe. You can shop with your girlfriend or be in your favorite bar with friends when the murder is done and you will be happy and free.</p>

<p>We have hitmen from our community but we are also accepting new members who can carry out our tasks. If you have something to offer you can sign up and contact us.</p>

<p>Most likely you won't find a lot of information about us on the net and hardly on TV. Our employers buy killings anonymously and keep silence. As for the police they do not want to promote our service.</p>

<p>Once the payment is transferred to escrow the admin will provide the details to the performer. Your work will be in process. Once done we send you proofs, after that you pay us.</p>
