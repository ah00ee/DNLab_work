<div id="content">
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>You are running Debian stable, because you prefer the Debian stable tree. It runs great, there is just one problem: the software is a little bit outdated compared to other distributions. This is where backports come in.</p>

<p>Backports are packages taken from the next Debian release (called
&quot;testing&quot;), adjusted and recompiled for usage on Debian stable. Because the
package is also present in the next Debian release, you can easily upgrade your
stable+backports system once the next Debian release comes out. (In a few
cases, usually for security updates, backports are also created from the Debian
unstable distribution.)</p>

<p>Backports cannot be tested as extensively as Debian stable, and backports
are provided on an as-is basis, with risk of incompatibilities with other
components in Debian stable. Use with care!</p>

<p>It is therefore recommended to only select single backported packages that fit
your needs, and not use all available backports.</p>

<h2>Where to start</h2>

<ul>
<li>Users should start at the <a href="./Instructions/">Instructions</a> page.</li>
<li>Contributors should start <a href="./Contribute/">Contribute</a> page.</li>
<li>If you want to know which packages are available via backports.debian.org look at the <a href="./Packages/">Packages</a> page.</li>

<p>Now that buster was released we are pleased to announce the availability of
buster-backports and stretch-backports-sloppy.</p>

<h2>What to upload where</h2>

<p> As a reminder, uploads to a release-backports pocket are to be taken
from release + 1, uploads to a release-backports-sloppy pocket are to be
taken from release + 2. Which means:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Source Distribution </th>
<th> Backports Distribution </th>
<th> Sloppy Distribution</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>buster               </td>
<td> stretch-backports      </td>
<td> -</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>bullseye             </td>
<td> buster-backports       </td>
<td> stretch-backports-sloppy</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<h2>Backports and LTS</h2>

<p>Please keep in mind that backports doesn&#39;t follow LTS. Which means that we will drop
support for oldstable (stretch) around one year after the release of buster. Thats in sync
with the - official - security support for <a href="https://www.debian.org/security/faq#lifespan">oldstable</a></p>

<h2>BSA Security Advisories</h2>

<p>We plan to switch the security-announce mailinglist to keyring based authentication, which means that
every DD and DM is able to publish its own BSA advisories. We will send out a seperate announcement
after the switch happened - and of course update the <a href="https://backports.debian.org/Contribute/#index4h2">documentation</a></p>

<h2>Statistics</h2>

<p> For packages backported from buster, so far we have 1624 different
source packages in stretch-backports. Those 1624 source packages took 2821 uploads
from 252 uploaders to become reality.</p>

<h2>Thanks</h2>

<p> Thanks have to go out to all people making backports possible, and that
includes up front the backporters themself who do upload the packages,
track and update them on a regular basis, but also the buildd team
making the autobuilding possible and the ftp masters for creating the
suites in the first place.</p>

<p>Happy Backporting!</p>

<p>Alex and Rhonda - backports.debian.org ftpmasters</p>

<pre><code>Bernhard Schmidt uploaded new packages for openvpn which fixed the
following security problems:

CVE-2017-7479

    It was discovered that openvpn did not properly handle the
    rollover of packet identifiers. This would allow an authenticated
    remote attacker to cause a denial-of-service via application
    crash.

CVE-2017-7508

    Guido Vranken discovered that openvpn did not properly handle
    specific malformed IPv6 packets. This would allow a remote
    attacker to cause a denial-of-service via application crash.

CVE-2017-7520

    Guido Vranken discovered that openvpn did not properly handle
    clients connecting to an HTTP proxy with NTLMv2
    authentication. This would allow a remote attacker to cause a
    denial-of-service via application crash, or potentially leak
    sensitive information like the user&#39;s proxy password.

CVE-2017-7521

    Guido Vranken discovered that openvpn did not properly handle
    some x509 extensions. This would allow a remote attacker to cause
    a denial-of-service via application crash.

For the jessie-backports distribution the problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.0-6+deb9u1~bpo8+1.

<p> With the release of stretch we are pleased to open the doors
for stretch-backports and jessie-backports-sloppy. \o/</p>

<p>As usual with a new release we will change a few things for
the backports service.</p>

<h2>What to upload where</h2>

<p> As a reminder, uploads to a release-backports pocket are to be taken

<h2>Deprecation of LTS support for backports</h2>

<p>We started supporting backports as long as there is LTS support as an
experiment. Unfortunately it didn&#39;t worked, most maintainers didn&#39;t
wanted to support oldoldstable-backports (squeeze) for the lifetime
of LTS. So things started to rot in squeeze and most packages didn&#39;t
received updates. After long discussions we decided to deprecate LTS
support for backports. From now on squeeze-backports(-sloppy) is closed
and will not receive any updates. Expect it to get removed from the
mirrors and moved to archive in the near future.</p>

<h2>BSA handling</h2>

<p>We - the backports team - didn&#39;t scale well in processing BSA requests.
To get things better in the future we decided to change the process a
little bit. If you upload a package which fixes security problems
please fill out the BSA template and create a ticket in the rt tracker
(see https://backports.debian.org/Contribute/#index3h2 for details).</p>

<h2>Stretching the rules</h2>

<p>From time to time its necessary to not follow the backports rules, like
a package needs to be in testing or a version needs to be in Debian.
If you think you have one of those cases, please talk to us on the list <strong>before</strong> upload the package.</p>

<h2>Thanks</h2>

<p> Thanks have to go out to all people making backports possible, and that
includes up front the backporters themself who do upload the packages,
track and update them on a regular basis, but also the buildd team
making the autobuilding possible and the ftp masters for creating the
suites in the first place.</p>

<p> We wish you a happy stretch <img alt=":)" src="./smileys/smile.png" />

<div class="inlinecontent">
<pre><code>      Dear users of the backports service!

 With the release of Jessie (coming up) we are pleased to open the doors
for jessie-backports and wheezy-backports-sloppy (mostly all
architectures are already buildable there, too).  Whee!

 But, PLEASE DO READ ON, there are some changes in the process that we
would like to do for the new upload pockets.


== What to upload where ==

 As a reminder, uploads to a release-backports pocket are to be taken
from release + 1, uploads to a release-backports-sloppy pocket are to be
taken from release + 2.  Which means:

 Source Distribution | Backports Distribution | Sloppy Distribution
---------------------|------------------------|--------------------------
 stretch             | jessie-backports       | wheezy-backports-sloppy
 jessie              | wheezy-backports       | squeeze-backports-sloppy


== We drop -v switch hard requirement ==

 We required uploads to contain the changelog entries since the former
version in stable in the changes file.  This was quite convenient for
people reading the changes through the changes mailinglist but
especially also for the backports team when processing packages.

 Given that the changelogs of former backports and the packages
backported are available through the packages.debian.org website
(amongst other sources) and that it was annoying to both backporters and
also us as backports team we are dropping it as hard requirement.  It
would still be pretty awesome for the above mentioned reasons if you
could keep it as part of your workflow, especially for uploads that end
in the policy queue, but we won&#39;t reject packages based solely on that
nymore.


== Versioning ==

 Previous we used ~bpo70+1 as suffix for the versions of uploads.  We
were asked whether we might want to align that with the other suffixes
used and drop the zero from within there, and yes, we will drop it.
This means that uploads to jessie-backports should use ~bpo8+1 as
suffix, and also wheezy-backports-sloppy uses ~bpo7+1 as suffix.

 For wheezy-backports please still use ~bpo70+1 version suffixes
because of sorting reasoning, especially if there are also
squeeze-backports-sloppy packages around.  Which brings us to ...


== squeeze-backports* ==

 As you are probably aware, squeeze is still a supported release through
LTS.  The same goes for the squeeze-backports* suites, you can consider
them to be around for the same timeframe that LTS is going to be around.


== Statistics ==

 For packages backported from jessie, so far we have 995 different
source packages in wheezy-backports, and 27 different source packages in
squeeze-backports-sloppy.  Those 995 source packages took 1729 uploads
to become reality.


== Thanks ==

 Thanks have to go out to all people making backports possible, and that
includes up front the backporters themself who do upload the packages,
track and update them on a regular basis, but also the buildd team
making the autobuilding possible and the ftp masters for creating the
suites in the first place.

 Enjoy, and continue being awesome!
Rhonda, on behalf of the Backports Team
